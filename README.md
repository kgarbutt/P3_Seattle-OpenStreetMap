# P3_Seattle-OpenStreetMap

Data Wrangling of a Seattle OpenStreetMap

Performed data munging techniques to analyze an OpenStreetMap dataset, and SQLite to query a large database. Utilized a 'shape_element' function to transform each element into the correct format for the database, and a process_map function to iteratively processes each XML element while writing to the csv file. And finally, queried the database for number of schools, top contributors, restaurants by city, art sculptures, and finished the analysis with suggestions on how to improve the dataset & how to implement the improvements.
